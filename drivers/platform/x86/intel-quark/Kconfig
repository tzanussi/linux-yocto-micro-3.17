	  Say Y here to enable eSRAM overlay and software-initiated ECC
	  updates. eSRAM overlaying allows for code/data structures to be
	  mapped into eSRAM thus providing far faster access to code/data
	  than ordinary DRAM. Slower than cache RAM faster than DRAM.

	 Say Y here to enable IMR feature available in Intel Quark X1000.
	 There is a total of 8 IMR zone can be used by user in the SoC.
	 By default, the kernel runtime memory region from _text to
